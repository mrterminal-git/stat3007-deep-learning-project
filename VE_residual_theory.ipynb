    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$R_{n,t}$**: Return of asset **n** at time **t**.\n",
    "- **$\\beta_{n,t-1}$**: Factor loading (sensitivity) of asset **n** at time **t-1**.\n",
    "- **$\\mathbf{F}_t$**: Vector of factor returns at time **t**.\n",
    "- **$\\varepsilon_{n,t}$**: Idiosyncratic error term for asset **n** at time **t**, assumed to be white noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "They use the factor model to remove common systematic risks and extract residuals from asset returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, cointegration was in our project because it is easy to intepret and we do not incorporate additional economic indications or characterisitics, as in G Ordonez.\n",
    "In the context of **global electrcity prices** cointegration provides a valid method for extracting arbitrage signals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons to choose Cointegration over Factor Models:\n",
    "1. Focus on Long-Run Equilibrium Relationships\n",
    "- Cointegration directly models long-term equilibrium between asset prices. If you believe two or more assets should revert to a common relationship over time (e.g., due to supply chains, regional electricity pricing, or corporate ownership links), cointegration is ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor models, by contrast, focus on cross-sectional risk exposure, not long-run relationships.\n",
    "___________________________________________________\n",
    "2. Minimal Economic Assumptions\n",
    "- Cointegration is purely statistical. It doesnâ€™t require assumptions about systematic risk factors or the existence of risk premia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This makes it useful in contexts where economic theory about risk factors is either weak or not applicable, such as in commodity markets, regional electricity markets, or cryptocurrencies.\n",
    "___________________________________________________\n",
    "3. Robust to Market-Wide Shocks\n",
    "- Cointegration-based strategies focus on relative price movements. They can ignore market-wide trends as long as the relationship between the assets holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor models rely on systematic factors, which can be misestimated, especially during structural market shifts.\n",
    "___________________________________________________\n",
    "4. Well-Suited for Stable, Linked Markets\n",
    "- In regulated or linked markets (e.g., electricity prices across connected regions, or currency pairs in tightly coupled economies), cointegration can capture structural relationships better than factor models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor models might not capture these specific cross-market dependencies unless those are explicitly modeled.\n",
    "___________________________________________________\n",
    "5. Fewer Data Requirements for Small Portfolios\n",
    "- Cointegration can be applied effectively with limited data or few assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor models often require broad cross-sectional data to reliably estimate factors and loadings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore cointegration is better in the context of global electricity prices because:\n",
    "- We are working with a few assets with known economic or physical linkages (e.g. parent/subsidary companies, regional energy markets)\n",
    "- The focus is on long-term price convergence, not cross-sectional risk factors\n",
    "- We have do not have economic theory about risk facors in the commodity markets\n",
    "- We do not have theoretical justifications about systematic risks behind Factor Models\n",
    "\n",
    "This report delves into finding the electricity prices between neighbouring regions, that would follow a long-run relationship due to shared infrastructure and demand patterns -- perfect for cointegration.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum it up, we should use cointegration because:\n",
    "- We want to model specific, stable, long-term relationships between a few assets\n",
    "- We seek a purely statistical approach without relying on economic risk factors\n",
    "- The market structure suggests a natural equillibrium"

    "### Overview:\n",
    "Cointegration is a statistical property of time series variables that indicates a **long-term equilibrium relationship** between them, even though the individual series may be non-stationary. In **statistical arbitrage**, cointegration is used to identify portfolios where a linear combination of asset prices or returns results in a **stationary residual**, enabling **mean-reverting trading strategies**.\n",
