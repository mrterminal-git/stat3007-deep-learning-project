    "Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing in simple terms (for an example with 3 assets):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We start with **251 days of price data** for 3 assets.\n",
    "2. From this, we calculate **250 days of \"residuals\"**, which tell us how far each asset is from its \"fair value\".\n",
    "3. Then, we take **rolling windows of 30 days** of the cumulative residuals, giving us 220 overlapping windows of recent market behaviour.\n",
    "4. Each 30-day window is given to a deep learning model (CNN + Transformer) to decide **how much of each asset we should long or short**.\n",
    "5. We test the model's prediction by checking **how well that portfolio performs on the next day**.\n",
    "6. Finally, we summarize the performance using the **Sharpe Ratio**, which balances return and risk. The model is trained to maximize this.\n",

    "___________________________\n",
    "- Ensure you normalize residuals or cumulative residuals properly before feeding them into the CNN, as this preprocessing is important for stability (see Ordonez‚Äôs mention of scaling the cumsum residuals).\n",
    "### How Ordo√±ez normalizes the residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "In the empirical implementation, Ordo√±ez applies **instance normalization** before each activation function in the CNN. The precise form is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x^{(1)}_{l,d} = \\text{ReLU} \\left( \\frac{y^{(0)}_{l,d} - \\mu^{(0)}_d}{\\sigma^{(0)}_d} \\right), \\quad\n",
    "x^{(2)}_{l,d} = \\text{ReLU} \\left( \\frac{y^{(1)}_{l,d} - \\mu^{(1)}_d}{\\sigma^{(1)}_d} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( \\mu^{(i)}_d \\) and \\( \\sigma^{(i)}_d \\) are the **mean** and **standard deviation** across the time axis \\( L \\), for each filter/channel \\( d \\).\n",
    "- This normalization happens **before ReLU activations** and **after the CNN‚Äôs linear transformations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is this normalization needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "They say it helps with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training stability**: Prevents saturation of ReLU units, reducing vanishing gradients.\n",
    "- **Optimization speed**: Normalized activations allow for more consistent gradient magnitudes.\n",
    "- **Generalization**: Keeps the learning dynamics balanced across different time periods and assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *\"...we include so-called 'instance normalization' before each activation function to speed up the optimization and avoid vanishing gradients caused by the saturation of the ReLU activations.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary for your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "You should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Normalize the **output of each CNN convolution** by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation **across time**, **per filter**.\n",
    "- Do this **before** applying nonlinearities like ReLU.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done **after cumulative residuals are created** ‚Äî so you do **not** normalize the raw residuals or cumulative residuals before feeding into the CNN. Instead, normalization is handled **inside the CNN layers**.\n",
    "\n",
    "____________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "- You might want to double-check whether the portfolio is dollar-neutral (i.e., weights sum to zero) ‚Äî this constraint is often enforced in statistical arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "G. Ordo√±ez ensures **dollar-neutrality** by **normalizing the portfolio weight vector to have an L1 norm of 1**, meaning the total absolute weight of long and short positions adds up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The final portfolio weights \\( \\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^R \\) are computed from an unscaled vector \\( \\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^\\varepsilon \\) using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^R = \\frac{(\\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^\\varepsilon)^\\top \\Phi_{t-1}}{\\left\\|(\\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^\\varepsilon)^\\top \\Phi_{t-1} \\right\\|_1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\( \\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^\\varepsilon \\): raw weights from the feedforward network.\n",
    "- \\( \\Phi_{t-1} \\): the mapping from factor space (residuals) to asset space.\n",
    "- The **L1 normalization** ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left\\| \\mathbf{w}_{t-1}^R \\right\\|_1 = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This constrains the portfolio to be **dollar-neutral** and leverage-controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this important?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Risk Control**  \n",
    "   Dollar-neutral portfolios remove exposure to the overall market (beta), so returns reflect **pure arbitrage** opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sharpe Ratio Consistency**  \n",
    "   Fixing total exposure prevents the model from inflating returns and risk through unbounded leverage. This makes **Sharpe ratio optimization meaningful**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparability and Robustness**  \n",
    "   Normalized weights allow **comparison across time** and **between models**, and simulate realistic trading strategies with constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"*We include this normalization step to prevent uncontrolled leverage and to focus on relative pricing discrepancies rather than market direction.*\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> G. Ordo√±ez enforces dollar-neutrality by **L1-normalizing** the raw allocation vector, ensuring **balanced long and short exposure**, better risk management, and robust out-of-sample optimization."
